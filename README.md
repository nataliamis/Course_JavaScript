# My workshop - JavaScript. :boom:
In this folder you will find several separate projects, which were to be done 
at one of the javascript workshops on the CodersLab bootcamp. 
There you can find a slider of photos, photo galleries with filter,
tooltips, an example of a simple drop-down menu.

## Technologies which I used!
> Javascript, CSS
## Site preview
>:exclamation:Unfortunately, due to the fact that they are separate projects, 
I can't show them on github pages - I would have to separate them separately into repositories.
But I invite you to look into the code! :raised_hands:
